React Lifecycle

Lifecycle of Components

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main
phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.


Mounting

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

1. constructor()
2. getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render()
4. componentDidMount()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be
called if you define them.


constructor

The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is
the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.

The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by
calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method
and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component)
