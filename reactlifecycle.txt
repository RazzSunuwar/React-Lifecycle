React Lifecycle

Lifecycle of Components

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main
phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating and Unmounting.


Mounting

Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

1. constructor()
2. getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render()
4. componentDidMount()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be
called if you define them.


constructor

The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is
the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.

The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by
calling the super(props) before anything else, this will initiate the parent's constructor method
and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component).


getDerivedStateFromProps

The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.

This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.

It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

The example below starts with the favorite color being "red", but the getDerivedStateFromProps()
method updates the favorite color based on the favcol attribute:


render
The render() method is required, and is the method that actual outputs HTML to the DOM.


componentDidMount

The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.

This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.



Updating
The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

1. getDerivedStateFromProps()
2. shouldComponentUpdate()
3. render()
4. getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
5. componentDidUpdate()

The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be
called if you define them.


getDerivedStateFromProps
Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. This is the first method that is
called when a component gets updated.

This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.

The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue, but since the
getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called, which updates the state with the color from the favcol
attribute, the favorite color is still rendered as yellow:



shouldComponentUpdate
In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.

The default value is true.

The example below shows what happens when the shouldComponentUpdate() method returns false:


render
The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.

The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue:
